      "blogText": "When Bitcoin was first invented, many hailed it as the solution to inefficient cross-border remittances. But because of the high fees associated with transactions on the BTC Core network, it has never been able to live up to its full potential.That’s why Kumaraguru Ramanujam has chosen to build on the Bitcoin SV blockchain instead. His application, MoneySwipe, aims to bring down fees for sending money abroad from the current global average of 7% to just 1.5%."

      "blogText": "MoneySwipe’s target is a bit different. Ramanujam tells the audience that he wants to change the remittance landscape, especially in his homeland of India, the world’s largest remittance destination. Last year, the country, which is home to 17% of the world’s population, received $87 billion in remittances, but the fees to the consumers are still way too high.The panelists noted that with Bitcoin SV’s massive scaling, very low fees, and real-time transactions, a new world of opportunities and business models has opened up. With micropayments, for instance, pay-per-use becomes a real possibility. And as Ramanujam pointed out, Bitcoin SV can also be used as a backend network on which stablecoins, which are regulatory compliant, are issued and settled.Best in class With all the developments in Bitcoin payments,consumers are spoilt for choice and sometimes can be overwhelmed. Centi’s Müller believes it may be about time for BSV payments to be standardized. This would allow the different platforms to inter-transact and offer customers more choice and diversity. Centi users who want to send remittances to India could do so directly through MoneySwipe and pay for their groceries through Centbee while enjoying Haste Arcade through HandCash.There’s a caveat, however."

      "blogText": "India is amongst the fastest growing fintech markets in the world. Of the 2,100+ fintechs existing in India today, over 67% have been set up in the last 5 years. The Indian fintech market is currently valued at $61 Bn and is expected to grow to $84 Bn by 2023.Reserve Bank of India(RBI) to spur innovation has set up Regulatory Sandbox from retail payment, cross-border payment to MSME lending. The regulatory sandbox allows the regulator, innovators, financial service providers and customers to conduct field tests to collect evidence on the benefits and risks of new financial innovations, while carefully monitoring and containing their risks. It can provide a structured avenue for the regulator to engage with the ecosystem and to develop innovation-enabling or innovation-responsive regulations that facilitate the delivery of relevant, low-cost financial products.The objective of the regulatory sandbox is to foster responsible innovation in financial services, promote efficiency and bring benefits to consumers. Innovators and fintech startups can improve their understanding of regulations that govern fintech offerings and shape their products accordingly.The Reserve Bank’s Regulatory Sandbox (RS) has so far introduced three cohorts. Six entities have successfully exited the First Cohort on ‘Retail Payments’ while under the Second Cohort on ‘Cross Border Payments’ eight entities are undertaking Tests.RBI in line with their vision to keep the fintech ecosystem engaged has decided to select ‘Prevention and Mitigation of Financial Frauds’ as the theme for the Fourth Cohort. The focus would be on using technology to reduce the lag between the occurrence and detection of frauds, strengthening the fraud governance structure and minimising response time to frauds.In addition, based on the experience gained and the feedback received from stakeholders, RBI’s ‘Enabling Framework for Regulatory Sandbox’ has been updated to include ‘On Tap’ application facility for themes of closed cohorts. Accordingly, the theme ‘Retail Payments’ is now open for application. This ‘On Tap’ facility is expected to help in continuous innovation and engagement with innovators and proactively respond to the dynamics of the rapidly evolving FinTech scenario.The opportunity here is timely, especially for BSV blockchain, to engage the government, showcase the real innovation behind BSV's scalable, sustainable, secure technology and how it can empower a billion-plus people with micro-transactions, secure payments, data sovereignty.The Indian financial industry has seen cumulative investments into domestic fintechs of more than $10 Bn since 2016. The Indian fintech industry ecosystem offers a wide range of subsegments, including Payments, Lending, Wealth Technology (WealthTech), Personal Finance Management, Insurance Technology (InsurTech), Regulation Technology (RegTech), etc.As a BSV entrepreneur and proud Indian, I invite BSV ventures, tech houses and associations to explore with us or individually the growth potential here in INDIA. Applying for the regulatory sandbox under the relevant cohort would be the goal.I am available on kumaraguru (at) blockreview.in for further discussion, "
